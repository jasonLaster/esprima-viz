## Esprima Viz

I hope that this viz will help people see what their AST looks like very quickly. This will probably be accompanied by a JSON tree viewer as well.

### Interaction
1. clicking on a bar will now "zoom" in on the section

### Next Steps

1. Add hover interaction for showing AST metadata
2. Cleanup the AST (currently a literal field shows up as is instead of being one bar)
